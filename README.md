api is fucking me rn, it doesnt works well with anothers codes/characters(trying to use %20 instead of whitespace ðŸ’©)...

now it needs to use syn.request func as game limits game.httpget by 500 uses per minute.

tomorrow gonna try to make a way to dont get the ip blocked by cloudflare so quickly(possibly gonna need to remove multi-thread)

^^ dont worry, just got a way to do it, i gonna host a website that gonna use the pastebin api to share any pastebin info, that way we dont gonna need to make a pastebin login system on roblox lol(as it needs a unique api_key per user, then i just gonna login on some random account at the website main .php file, and save the key in a variable).
